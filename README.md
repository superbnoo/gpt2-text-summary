Generating Text Summary With GPT2

I was playing with BERT, and GPT, using pretrained model and then finetuning for several tasks of interest, particularly abstractive text summary.

## Dataset Preparation
The training dataset is already preprocessed(taken from [https://github.com/SKRohit/Generating_Text_Summary_With_GPT2]) and hosted here [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZH3owx7KFZn36q0rEelKyn4PpUq_0H6H/edit]

    
## Training
Run the following colab ipynb book
https://colab.research.google.com/github/superbnoo/gpt2-text-summary/blob/main/demo.ipynb
